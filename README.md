## How Treblle Works
Once youâ€™ve integrated a Treblle SDK in your codebase, this SDK will send requests and response data to your Treblle Dashboard.

In your Treblle Dashboard you get to see real-time requests to your API, auto-generated API docs, API analytics like how fast the response was for an endpoint, the load size of the response, etc.

Treblle also uses the requests sent to your Dashboard to calculate your API score which is a quality score thatâ€™s calculated based on the performance, quality, and security best practices for your API.

> Visit [https://docs.treblle.com](http://docs.treblle.com) for the complete documentation.

## Security

### Masking fields
Masking fields ensure certain sensitive data are removed before being sent to Treblle.

To make sure masking is done before any data leaves your server [we built it into all our SDKs](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#fields-masked-by-default).

This means data masking is super fast and happens on a programming level before the API request is sent to Treblle. You can [customize](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#custom-masked-fields) exactly which fields are masked when youâ€™re integrating the SDK.

> Visit the [Masked fields](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields) section of the [docs](https://docs.sailscasts.com) for the complete documentation.


## Get Started

1. Sign in to [Treblle](https://identity.treblle.com/login).
2. [Create a Treblle project](https://docs.treblle.com/en/dashboard/projects#creating-a-project).
3. [Setup the SDK](#install-the-SDK) for your platform.

### Install the SDK

```bash
composer require treblle/treblle-lumen
```

## Getting started

Installing Lumen packages is a lot more complicated than Laravel packages and requires a few manual steps. If you want a completely automated process please use Laravel.

### Step 1: Publish config files

The first thing we need to do is publish the Treblle config file and make sure Lumen loads it. To do that we need to copy/paste the package config file like so:

```bash
mkdir -p config
cp vendor/treblle/treblle-lumen/config/treblle.php config/treblle.php
```

Now we can have Lumen load the config file. We do that by adding a new line in `bootstrap/app.php`, under the _Register Config Files_ section, like so:

```php
$app->configure('treblle');
```


We need to register the Treblle middleware in Lumen. To do add a new line of code to `bootstrap/app.php`, under the Register Middleware section, like so:

```php
$app->routeMiddleware([
    'treblle' => Treblle\Middlewares\TreblleMiddleware::class
]);
```


You need an [API key](https://docs.treblle.com/en/dashboard#accessing-your-api-key) and [Project ID](https://docs.treblle.com/en/dashboard/projects#project-id) for Treblle to work. You can get those by creating a FREE account on [treblle.com](https://treblle.com) and your first project. You'll get the two keys which you need to add to your `.ENV` file like so:

```bash
TREBLLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

## Enable Treblle on your API

Now that we've installed the package we simply need to enable it. Open **routes/web.php** and assign the **treblle** middleware to your API routes like so:

```php
$router->group(['prefix' => 'api', 'middleware' => 'treblle'], function () use ($router) {
    $router->get('users',  ['uses' => 'UserController@index']);
    $router->post('users',  ['uses' => 'TestController@store']);
});
```

**You're all set**. Next time someone makes a request to your API you will see it in real-time on your Treblle dashboard.
